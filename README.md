  A capstone project for App Academy
</p>

<h2>About The Project</h2>
<p>The idea for this project came about while on a walk with my significant other to look at wild rabbits. I jokingly wished for an app that could tell you if there were rabbits around so you could find them more easily. After beginning my Software Engineering journey at App Academy, I thought about this idea more and more. Wouldn't it be great to help people find adoptable rabbits in the area more easily? Something that can help them decide if a rabbit is the right pet for them? Thus, Buns in your area was created! I hope you have fun with it!</p>
